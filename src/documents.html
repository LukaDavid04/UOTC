			<br><br><h1>Division One Player Commitment Policy</h1>
			<br><h4>Committing to the Division 1 Tennis Team:</h4>
			<br><p>Tennis players selected to play in the top division, division 1, of university tennis for the University of Ottawa Tennis Club (UOTC) are competitive, hard-working, and motivated players. Tennis players who accept this position must make a large commitment to the team. After the UOTC tryouts, certain players will be offered the chance to train and compete on the division 1 team based on their skill level on the tennis court. During tryouts, players will be evaluated based on their physical and mental skill set. A player’s attitude on and off the court will also be factored into this decision.</p>
			<br><h4>Division 1 Player Fee:</h4>
			<br><p>Players can accept or decline this offer to play on the Division 1 team. If a player decides to accept their offer, they must then pay a ‘Player Fee’. This fee will be decided by the President and Treasurer of the UTOC in collaboration with the Rideau Sports Centre, the local private tennis facility. The Player Fee will cover court fees, competition travel, and apparel of that Division 1 player for a full fall or winter semester. </p>
			<p>Each player must pay the Player Fee on time, and keep either an electronic or paper record of the transaction. The Player Fee is the same for every player regardless of their tennis ability. However, the cost can vary per semester based on changes to prime time and/or non-prime time courts fees at the Rideau Sports Center. Once the Player Fee is paid, the player will have two weeks to decide whether they still want to commit and play on the team.</p>
			<p>If the player chooses to no longer participate on the team within the two-week period, they will receive a full refund of their Player Fee. After the two-week period has expired, the player can no longer receive a refund of their Player Fee.</p>
			<br><h4>Division 1 Team Practice Commitment:</h4>
			<br><p>Following payment, all Division 1 players must commit to practice. The UTOC will have three weekly tennis practices. The dates and times of club practices will be determined by UTOC Executives in collaboration with the team captains, Division 1 players, and court availability. All players will be notified of practice dates and times as soon as possible. Practices will be run by Tennis Canada certified coach and UOTC veteran Zhenya Kondratovski. Zhenya is a former top ranked USSR junior tennis player. Othman Ennaciri and Hannah Atkinson (UOTC team captains) will help Coach Zhenya run practice when necessary. Practices will focus on the improvement and development of Division 1 players’ tennis skills. Practices will include drills, specific point situations, and match-play. </p>
			<br><h4>Practice Arrival Time:</h4>
			<br><p>Attending practice is mandatory for all Division 1 tennis players. Players are expected to arrive five to ten minutes prior to the start of practice. For example, if practice is scheduled at 7:00am, players should aim to arrive at 6:50am, and change into tennis gear, shoes, etc. by 6:55am. This will allow practice to begin on-time, every time. Players arriving early should also warm up their bodies in order to minimize physical injury during practice. </p>
			<p>Being late is defined as arriving any time after the first five minutes of practice. Therefore, if practice is scheduled at 7:00am and a player arrives at 7:05am, they are considered late. It is each player’s responsibility to notify their respective male or female captain whether they are unable to attend. Arriving to practice late or failing to attend practice without justification will result in consequences for the player.</p>
			<br><h4>Consequences for Lateness:</h4>
			<br><p>It is the player’s responsibility to make any necessary arrangements in order to arrive at practice on-time. </p>
			<p>With regards to timeliness, the first time a player shows up late will result in a warning from their captain. The player will be allowed to join practice when they arrive. A second late arrival will result in the player having to wait until their captain deems appropriate for them to join practice. Any further late arrivals for the player will result in them not being allowed to participate in practice. Therefore, the player will be considered absent for the practice.</p>
			<p>With regards to absences from practice, any absence from practice which has been justified will not result in any penalty for the player; no matter the number of justified absences. Justifiable absences can include personal reasons, midterm examinations, class lecture, laboratory class, university trips, and physical or mental injury. However, captains can also decide whether or not the player’s justification was appropriate. </p>
			<br><h4>Absence Justification:</h4>
			<br><p>Players have 24 hours prior to practice to justify their absence to their captain. For example, if a player was unable to attend a 7:00am to 9:00am practice Monday morning due to the fact that he/she had a midterm that same Monday morning at 8:30am, that player has until Tuesday morning at 7:00am to notify their captain justifying their absence. It is suggested players justify their absence as early as possible. To clarify, justifying an absence is defined as the player notifying their captain within 24 hours of the most recent practice that he/she cannot attend practice for the following date due to one or more of the reasons listed above. An absence is then deemed unjustified if the respective captain receives a notification beyond the 24-hour time limit or no notification from the player at all. </p>
			<p>With regards to unjustified absences, if a player misses practice, doesn’t notify their captain on-time with their justification, and then arrives to the next practice, it becomes the captain’s decision whether the player can participate in that respective practice. </p>
			<br><h4>Consequences for Three or More Unjustified Absences:</h4>
			<br><p>If a player has three or more unjustified absences, they will no longer be considered part of the Division 1 team. The player no longer be allowed to attend Division 1 practices, and the player will lose the opportunity to compete against other universities with the Division 1 team. The player will not receive a refund of their Player Fee. The player may then choose to participate in division 2 practices or wait until the following semester to re-join Division 1 if he/she wishes to do so. </p>
