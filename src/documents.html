			<br><br><h2>Division One Player Commitment Policy</h2>
			<br><h4>Committing to the Division 1 Tennis Team:</h4>
			<br><p>Tennis players selected to play in the top division, division 1, of university tennis for the University of Ottawa Tennis Club (UOTC) are competitive, hard-working, and motivated players. Tennis players who accept this position must make a large commitment to the team. After the UOTC tryouts, certain players will be offered the chance to train and compete on the division 1 team based on their skill level on the tennis court. During tryouts, players will be evaluated based on their physical and mental skill set. A player’s attitude on and off the court will also be factored into this decision.</p>
			<br><h4>Division 1 Player Fee:</h4>
			<br><p>Players can accept or decline this offer to play on the Division 1 team. If a player decides to accept their offer, they must then pay a ‘Player Fee’. This fee will be decided by the President and Treasurer of the UTOC in collaboration with the Rideau Sports Centre, the local private tennis facility. The Player Fee will cover court fees, competition travel, and apparel of that Division 1 player for a full fall or winter semester. </p>
			<p>Each player must pay the Player Fee on time, and keep either an electronic or paper record of the transaction. The Player Fee is the same for every player regardless of their tennis ability. However, the cost can vary per semester based on changes to prime time and/or non-prime time courts fees at the Rideau Sports Center. Once the Player Fee is paid, the player will have two weeks to decide whether they still want to commit and play on the team.</p>
			<p>If the player chooses to no longer participate on the team within the two-week period, they will receive a full refund of their Player Fee. After the two-week period has expired, the player can no longer receive a refund of their Player Fee.</p>
