						<p><strong>Emilie Temmerman</strong> is an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the University of Ottawa Tennis Club. Emilie started playing tennis at the
						age of 11 after she found an old tennis racket in the attic. She made her mom buy tennis balls and started hitting
						against the wall for hours on end. It drove her mom crazy so she eventually registered me for a tennis camp. This was
						the start of her love affair with tennis.</p><p> As a junior, she played Belgian Championships twice (singles and interclub).
						She started coaching when she was 16 and has been coaching for 17 years now. She has experience working with all ages
						(3-90). She has coached kid's tennis, private lessons, tennis camps. She also worked for the Flemish Tennis Association
						(Tennis Vlaanderen) promoting tennis at sports events. She still loves to compete as well.</p><p>Last year, her interclub team
						played the semi-final of the Belgian Championships. Not only has tennis given her the chance to grow as a player and a
						human being, but she has also developed lifelong friendships. She did all my coach development courses in Belgium (ITF
						recognized) and is currently getting an equivalency with Tennis Canada (Club Pro 2).

						course in Municipal and Land Use Planning Law. Alan is a life-long tennis player with a love of the game that far

						documents for administrative use and to advise on any organisational decisions.

						future.

						Conservative Candidate for riding in Orleans. He continues to regularly play and enjoy the sport of tennis. Having

						Marketing and Communications Executives in approaching new sponsors, and growing our fundraising outreach.
					</p> 
					<p>
						<strong>Mrs. Julie Smyth</strong> is a tennis enthusiast and member of the Rockcliffe Lawn Tennis Club (RLTC) in Ottawa. She has played and followed
						tennis for more than 30 years and is an active member of the Ottawa tennis community. Julie is a volunteer executive

						the club and attends National Capital Tennis Association (NCTA) AGMs on behalf of RLTC. Julie has degrees in business

						worked as a reporter at leading national newspapers in Canada and Scotland, then worked as a freelance writer, federal government speechwriter and marketing content creator. She has two teenagers, one

						suggestions to the UOTC; especially to the Treasurer of the UOTC.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Mr. Max Zimmerman</strong> is a graduate of the Honours program in Communications at the University of Ottawa. He began playing tennis at the age
