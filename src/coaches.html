							<p><strong>Ramin Anam</strong> is an <strong>Assistant Coach</strong> for the
								University of Ottawa Tennis Club.
							</p>
							<p>His journey in tennis began when he started
								playing at the age of 13. While learning this sport was frustrating and
								a challenge, he was encouraged to continue to develop his game by his family, regularly
								practicing with his father and
								sister.</p>
							<p>
								Ramin had the privilege of being mentored by a number of excellent coaches in Ottawa who
								shared their love of the sport
								through their teachings.
								Looking to complete his volunteer hours for highschool, Ramin worked at a March Break
								tennis camp; this was the start of
								his coaching journey. Now, a decade later, Ramin is a full time tennis pro at the Tennis
								Center West Ottawa. Ramin holds
								the Tennis Canada certified Club Pro 1 designation and is currently pursuing
								certification as a Club Pro 2.
								He enjoys finding new methods to improve his skills and knowledge so he can help his
								students learn and develop in their
								own way. Ramin is always thrilled to be a part of a player's tennis journey as they
								strive to reach their potential.
