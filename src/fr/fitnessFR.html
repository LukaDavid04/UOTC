			<h2 style="text-indent: 2%;">Weekly Training Plan</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-top: 1.5%;">The University of Ottawa Tennis Club (UOTC) runs numerous weekly practices for its players at the Rideau Sports Centre (RSC), with each one being very similar in structure and attendance being mandatory in order to be considered for competitions.  Practices are split up based on the divisions of teams, with Division 1 being the travelling and competing team, Division 2 being the secondary team who hope to improve enough to make the Division 1 team and Division 3 being the recreational team who are learning the basics of tennis.  All of the men’s and women’s teams play together in order to grow as a together and raise each other up, the only dividing factor being the division by which players are grouped by.  Practices, regardless of division, always start with a tennis specific dynamic and hitting warm-up followed by live ball and basket drills with aim to improve footwork and agility, finished with game situations and match play.</p>
			<p>Practices for the Division 1 teams are held three times per week (Monday, Thursday and Friday for the 2019-’20 school year) in the mornings before classes start.  They are held for a duration of two hours, occupying 2-3 courts based on team size, with the head coach running practices twice a week and team captains/assistant coaches running the other one.  Earlier in the week, I try to give the team a harder workout as well as expose them to a high volume of balls through basket feeding, where I am able to work with smaller groups (usually 4-6 people) in order to give each player specific, targeted feedback on whichever skill we are focusing on that week.  This ensures that each player always has something to be working towards, as practicing with a target in mind is much more productive than merely hitting the balls.</p>
			<p>Practices for Division 2 and 3 teams are held together twice a week (Monday and Wednesday for the 2019-’20 school year) in the evenings after classes finish.  They are held for an hour, with the players occupying 1-2 courts based again on the team size, with a player from the Division 1 team volunteering their time to coach (Jacob Leong and Elizabeth Ross this past year).  Here the players of Division 3 learn basic tennis skills such as proper technique for groundstrokes and serves and those in Division 2 improve on their existing foundation through improving movement and fine-tuning other skills.</p>
			<p>Some of the terms listed above may perhaps be foreign to those not immersed in the tennis world, so to elaborate on what practices look like, some of the key points of each practice are highlighted below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Physical warm up.</strong> Running, Joint mobilization, activation, ballistic/dynamic stretches (body twists, shoulder, hip rotations, balance, agility, as well as coordination and tennis specific footwork, like shuffle and crossover steps).  Should take 10 minutes before practice, hence the importance of arriving early.</li>
				<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Tennis- specific warm up,</strong> on half court (divided lengthwise), where players run through all four basic game situations: both on the baseline, one at the net whereas the other is still on the baseline, serve and return of serve.  Players work on their ball control (height, spin, speed, direction).  The process goals are to ensuring all basic fundamentals are met: proper set up (getting to the ball), impact zone (generally waist to chest height), contact point on the racquet and recovery back to starting position. We use a warm up style adopted from NCAA Division 1 Pennsylvania State University’s Tennis Team, which is outcome based but technique orientated, starting with groundstrokes, volleys, alternating both, then both players back, including down the line and cross court quality ball, usually three teams of 15-20 in a row from all courts before we move to next live ball drill.  Usually takes the first 15-20 minutes of practice.</li>
				<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Review objectives for the day, demo of the situation/skill </strong>which we will be focusing on.  5 minutes after the warm up, when all the players are drinking water. Depending on if we are in a preparatory, pre-competitive or competitive phase of our season, practice would be either more general (lots of repetition or volume, footwork, etc.); or if we have some matches and need to get ready, I would narrow it down to more specific game situations and patterns, like offence-defense (one person attacks the ball), “serve plus one” or “return plus one” (the “plus one” denoting an extra shot is hit in which the objective is to properly set up the point), approach down the line off the high or low ball (to get to the net), etc.  Topics for practice would look like this:</li>

			</ul>
			<i>
			<p>“Maintaining consistency from the baseline, when receiving wide, close, deep and short balls and 
				footwork necessary to achieving this”</p>
			<p>“Developing a weapon and taking control from the middle of the court, using a forehand”</p>
			<p>“Neutralizing the opponent off their 1st serve and/or attacking their weaker 2nd serve”</p>
			<p>“Approaching and coming to the net in order to take time and space away from opponent”</p>
			<p>“Serve and returns, practicing to hit specific targets with different types of balls (spin, slice, etc.)”</p>
			<p>“Patterns off serve and serve return in order to ensure best position to win the point”</p>
			<p>“Defensive skills when receiving low and/or wide balls which pull you off the court” </p>
			<p>“Doubles strategy, positioning and communication”</p>
			</i>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Stations work.</strong>  This involves basket work with the coach, serve and return practice on one court (targets specific to what is being worked on, like types of serve [eg. win a game just using flat, spin or slice serves]), and finally, a game situation, if we have a third court.  In case, drills requiring less courts are available, cardio drills with lots of basket fed balls and quicker rotations are used. This is how I would unfold the topic of “Maintaining consistency from the baseline when receiving wide, close and short balls”.  Emphasis on setting up for the ball through the use of positional bursts, getting behind the ball and maintaining consistent impact height and contact point, and recovering back to the original position after hitting said ball with a recovery burst.  To ensure higher level of demand on players’ footwork, recovery markers are there to give reference as to where players should be recovering to, before performing their split step.  Station work (groups of 4-6 players cycling through each station) includes any mix of:</li>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Hand feeding.</strong> Two players at a time, 3-4 balls being hand fed and players rotate out. Start with closer balls and gradually increase the challenge and court coverage. Rotate columns after each set or half way through basket. Other players are doing the agility ladder, medicine ball, shadow swing. 10-15 min. This type of practice allows coach to be closer to players and control the intensity of the players, also great for footwork and consistency.</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Basket feeding</strong> from the other side, increase the distance of the feed and add more challenge for players to recognize and track the ball, which is more realistic. 15-20 min</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Game situation,</strong> “king of the court”, rally games (3-2-1, 21 points, “la vache”), incorporating the skills and scoring system, as well as rotation, including rotation of players between courts. 15 min</li>
						<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Match play.</strong> Singles, doubles or “king of the court”. Scores are recorded, when challenge matches played. Coach can circulate and help out players with targeted feedback on tactics, technical and mental aspects. Individualize, while still insisting on keeping the consistency and overall focused athletic look and proper motivation. Vary match ups, rotate after 15-20 minutes and finish with doubles.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 3%; text-align: center;">Sample Weekly Training Plan for Division 1 – Pre-Competitive Phase (build up to game day)</h3>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 2%;">Characteristics:</h5>
			<p>1-3 weeks leading up to competitions.  Specific, higher intensity, mindful training but with lower repetitions. All drills and points are fashioned in order to simulate the competition state of mind.</p>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 2%;">Objectives:</h5>
			<p>Ensure that players are match-ready and able to perform their best on game day. Here we make	small adjustments but do not push the players to beyond their maximums.</p>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 2%;">Technical – Tactical:</h5>
			<p>Full court drills and rallying games with set restrictions.  Done in order to stimulate a game and to fine-tune certain areas.  Ex. we simulate attacking and defensive scenarios to build strategy and situational awareness. Targeted tactical feedback is given but no major technical changes are given as to not confuse the player before their match.</p>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 2%;">Physical:</h5>
			<p>Maintaining a sense of physical improvement, focusing on agility, speed and power on the court. We focus on short-burn energy systems in order to prevent lactic acid buildup (2-5s quick bursts of speed).  This is done with ball recognition drills, short sprints and plyometrics. Goal is to maintain footwork on court while reducing anaerobic training.</p>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 2%;">Mental:</h5>
			<p>Maintaining a positive work environment is key leading up to an event.  This allows organic comradery to grow, resulting in encouragement and praise of the players’ strengths, boosting confidence levels. Emphasis on a positive, growth mindset as well as emotional control through breathing in order to keep a level head when performing.  This is all in hope to foster problem solving on the field, in the spur of a moment.</p>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 2%;">Competition Styles in Practice:</h5>
			<p>Emphasis on simulating match style of play through match play between players, scrimmages in both singles and doubles without any restrictions.  This is done without regard to personal level of play or placement on the roster in order to allow players opportunity to face different styles of tennis.</p>
			<h4 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2%;">Monday, 7:00 - 9:00 am</h4>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 1%;">Warm-up:</h5>
			<p>Warm up adopted from Pennsylvania State University.</p>
			<h5>Points of Emphasis of the Practice:</h5>
			<p>Consistency from the baseline with emphasis on ball recognition and footwork necessary to set up for the ball and recover after hitting. Movement in all directions on court (lateral, longitudinal and diagonal movements and their necessary footwork).</p>
			<h5>Stations and Drills:</h5>
			<p>Rally games and points as well as serve and return practice to targets (serve plus one patterning). Hand feeding (balls in all directions) with coach making minute technical adjustments while the others who aren’t hitting are on the agility ladder. </p>
			<h5>Duration:</h5>
			<p>15-20-minute rotations between serves/returns, hand feeding and rally games.</p>
			<h5>Competing Styles in Practice (Last 40-60 minutes of Practice)</h5>
			<p>Either 1-on-1 (1x1) or 2-on-1 (2x1). Rally games are played with slight restrictions such as: rally of four balls needed to trigger start of point or one person can only hit one type of shot. Followed by match play.</p>
			<h4 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2%;">Thursday, 7:00 - 9:00 am</h4>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 1%;">Warm-up:</h5>
			<p>Warm up adopted from Pennsylvania State University.</p>
			<h5>Points of Emphasis of the Practice:</h5>
			<p>Taking control from the middle of the court (so they are unable to move you as much as you are moving them). Serve patterns in order to open the court up with an out-wide serve.</p>
			<h5>Stations and Drills:</h5>
			<p>‘Offence-Defense’ – 1x1 game where “offence” is able to hit anywhere but “defense” can only hit to the middle (so offence takes control from the middle). </p>
			<p>‘Slice-Roll’ – 2x1 game where the team of 2 can only hit slices from the baseline whereas the 1 can only hit topspin.</p>
			<p>Serve practice working on patterns (eg. ‘82’ – hitting an out-wide serve then hitting the “plus-one” to the other side of the court) </p>
			<h5>Duration:</h5>
			<p>15-20-minute rotations between serves/returns and the other drills.</p>
			<h5>Competing Styles in Practice (Last 40-60 minutes of Practice)</h5>
			<p>1x1 rally games such as 3-2-1 (up to 21) where finishing at the net is equivalent to 3 points, a winner 2 and unforces error 1.  Followed by “serve-plus-one” pattern games and match play.</p>
			<h4 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2%;">Friday, 7:00 - 9:00 am</h4>
			<h5 style="margin-top: 1%;">Warm-up:</h5>
			<p>‘Up and Down the River’ – played on half the court, singles and if you win (first to 7), move up one half court, and losers move down.</p>
			<p>‘Singles-Doubles’ – played on half the court as singles, when one side of court is finished the point, yells “doubles” and the whole court opens up with the two people on the same side being on the same team.</p>			
			<h5>Points of Emphasis of the Practice:</h5>
			<p>Approaching the net to finish the point with a volley as well as a player’s transition game (approach shot).  This is in order to take time and space away from your opponent to limit their reaction times.</p>
			<h5>Stations and Drills:</h5>
			<p>Basket feeding drills with different types of shots to approach off of (different balls warrant different methods of hitting the approach shot) as well as balls to hit an angled or “cut” volley off of. Focus of approach shot is to make contact with the ball waist to chest height before exploding to the net (usually only have time for 2 steps) before split stepping.</p>
			<h5>Duration:</h5>
			<p>15-20-minute rotations between focus points.</p>
			<h5>Competing Styles in Practice (Last 40-60 minutes of Practice)</h5>
			<p>Start off with “la vache”, transitioning to 2x2 volley/transition games and match play.</p><br>
