                    Division 2 & 3 Team
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our Division 2/3 team is the recreational team of the UOTC for players looking to improve their game
                    and have fun on the courts. Those divisions were established to make tennis
                    accessible for university students who want to try the sport out, and is open to
                    all levels, from beginners to 4.0 NTRP (Men and Women).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>
                    Division 2</h5>
                <p>
                    Classified as the Division 1 feeder division, the players in this division of the club often are
                    those who were at the
                    top of their regional or local competition groups. They are also very good tennis players and are
                    coached by the
                    Division 1 captains in hopes of gaining a spot on the Division 1 roster.
                </p>
                <h5>Division 3</h5>
                <p>
                    Typically composed of beginner or intermediate players, the
                    University of Ottawa wants to
                    spread the sport across the campus and facilitate a low barrier for entry, organised sport similar
                    to that of the
                    intramurals. This division is coached by both the captains of the Division 1 team, as well as other
                    players on the
                    Division 1 roster who want to help out.</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Practice Schedule</h5>
                <p>
                    Practices for Division 2 and 3 are held together. We hold practices up to 3 times a week,
                    run by our Division 1 players. (More info to come on the exact days and time).
                </p>
                <p>Similarly to Division 1, the focus points during training are as follow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical warm up.</strong> Running, Joint mobilization, activation,
                        ballistic/dynamic stretches (body twists, shoulder, hip rotations, balance, agility, as well
                        as coordination and tennis specific footwork, like shuffle and crossover steps). Should take
                        10 minutes before practice, hence the importance of arriving early.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Tennis- specific warm up,</strong> on half court (divided
                        lengthwise), where players run through all four basic game situations: both on the baseline,
                        one at the net whereas the other is still on the baseline, serve and return of serve.
                        Players work on their ball control (height, spin, speed, direction). The process goals are
                        to ensuring all basic fundamentals are met: proper set up (getting to the ball), impact zone
                        (generally waist to chest height), contact point on the racquet and recovery back to
                        starting position. We use a warm up style adopted from NCAA Division 1 Pennsylvania State
                        University’s Tennis Team, which is outcome based but technique orientated, starting with
                        groundstrokes, volleys, alternating both, then both players back, including down the line
                        and cross court quality ball, usually three teams of 15-20 in a row from all courts before
                        we move to next live ball drill. Usually takes the first 15-20 minutes of practice.</li>

                    <li><strong>Stations work.</strong> This involves basket work with the coach, serve and return
                        practice on one court (targets specific to what is being worked on, like types of serve [eg.
                        win a game just using flat, spin or slice serves]), and finally, a game situation. Cardio
                        drills with lots of basket fed balls and quicker rotations are used. Emphasis on setting up
                        for the ball through the use of positional bursts, getting behind the ball and maintaining
                        consistent impact height and contact point, and recovering back to the original position
                        after hitting said ball with a recovery burst. To ensure higher level of demand on players’
                        footwork, recovery markers are there to give reference as to where players should be
                        recovering to, before performing their split step. Station work (groups of 4-6 players
                        cycling through each station) includes any mix of:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Hand feeding.</strong> Two players at a time, 3-4
                            balls being hand fed and players rotate out. Start with closer balls and gradually
                            increase the challenge and court coverage. Rotate columns after each set or half way
                            through basket. Other players are doing the agility ladder, medicine ball, shadow swing.
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Basket feeding</strong> from the other side, increase
                            the distance of the feed and add more challenge for players to recognize and track the
                            ball, which is more realistic.</li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Game situation,</strong> “king of the court”, rally
                            games (3-2-1, 21 points, “la vache”), incorporating the skills and scoring system, as
                            well as rotation, including rotation of players between courts.</li>
                        <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Match play.</strong> Singles, doubles or “king of the
                            court”. Coach can circulate and help out players with targeted feedback on tactics,
                            technical and mental aspects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
