				<br><h2>Why Join the UOTC?</h2>
				<br><p>The UOTC is a bilingual club structured for any student interested in learning and/or playing
					tennis. Tennis is an incredibly fun sport to learn and play. The physical and mental benefits of
					participating in any type of physical activity or exercise are extremely beneficial to improving
					your overall health and well-being. We highly recommend you consider joining our club. The
					UOTC has Tennis Canada certified coaches that can help you improve your game or introduce
					you to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
				<br><h2>What’s the Difference Between the Three Divisions?</h2>
				<br><p>The UOTC is composed of three divisions tailored to different players’ tennis levels; Division 1,
					Division 2, and Division 3. Division 1 is for students who are competitive and experienced tennis
					players seeking to train and compete regularly throughout each semester. Division 2 is for
					students who consider themselves intermediate tennis players; students who play the sport, but
					are less experienced, and are interested in practicing. Division 3 is for students with little or no
					background in tennis. This division is specific for passionate, and curious students who want to
					learn the basics in how to play tennis.</p>
				<br><h2>How Much Does It Cost to Join the UOTC?</h2>
				<br><p>After tryouts, our coaching staff will decide which division best suits your level of tennis. Once
					you join the division, there is a membership fee to pay. The membership fee for each division is
					determined by the Treasurer. The price may vary each depending on courts fees, the numbers of
					weekly practices, and the numbers of players in your division. Players will be contacted
					regarding their membership fee after the division rosters are determined. All players of the same
					division must pay the same fee; regardless of their level of tennis and/or whether they are a new
					or returning UOTC player.</p>
				<br><h2>How Many Practices are there for Each Division?</h2>
				<br><p>Division 1 has three weekly practices, each of which is two hours long. Division 2 and 3 have two weekly practices, each of which are one to one and a half hours long.</p>
				<br><h2>Where are Practices Held?</h2>
				<br><p>UOTC holds all practices at the Rideau Sports Center (RSC).</p>

				<br><p>Please feel free to <a href="index.html#contact">contact us.</a></p>
				<br><h2>I Can No Longer Commit to the UOTC. Can I get a Refund of my Membership Fee?</h2>
				<br><p>Yes and no. Upon request, any player who decides they can no longer play on the UOTC can receive a full refund within THREE weeks of having paid their membership fee. However, AFTER the three weeks have expired, there is no guarantee for a full refund. </p>
				<br><h2>Do You Provide Tennis Rackets for Players?</h2>
				<br><p>Usually, players are required to bring a racket. However, if you do not have one, please <a href="index.html#contact">contact us</a> in advance and we will make arrangements to get you one. </p>
