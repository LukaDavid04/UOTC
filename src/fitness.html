				<p style="margin-top: 1.5%;">The University of Ottawa Tennis Club (UOTC) runs numerous weekly practices for its players, with each one being very similar in structure and attendance being mandatory in order to be considered for competitions. Practices are split up based on the divisions of teams, with Division 1 being the most competitive and the team that competes in Ontario University Athletic competitions and Winter Nationals, Division 2 being the secondary team who hope to improve enough to make the Division 1 team and Division 3 being the recreational team who are learning the basics of tennis.  All of the men’s and women’s teams play together in order to grow as a together and raise each other up, the only dividing factor being the division by which players are grouped by.  Practices, regardless of division, always start with a tennis specific dynamic and hitting warm-up followed by live ball and basket drills with aim to improve footwork and agility, finished with game situations and match play.</p>
				<p>Practices for the Division 1 teams are held twice times a week for a duration of two hours. Practices for Division 2 and 3 teams are held together twice a week for a duration of 2 hours as well.</p>
				<p>Some of the terms listed above may perhaps be foreign to those not immersed in the tennis world, so to elaborate on what practices look like, some of the key points of each practice are highlighted below.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Physical warm up.</strong> Running, Joint mobilization, activation, ballistic/dynamic stretches (body twists, shoulder, hip rotations, balance, agility, as well as coordination and tennis specific footwork, like shuffle and crossover steps).  Should take 10 minutes before practice, hence the importance of arriving early.</li>
					<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Tennis- specific warm up,</strong> on half court (divided lengthwise), where players run through all four basic game situations: both on the baseline, one at the net whereas the other is still on the baseline, serve and return of serve.  Players work on their ball control (height, spin, speed, direction).  The process goals are to ensuring all basic fundamentals are met: proper set up (getting to the ball), impact zone (generally waist to chest height), contact point on the racquet and recovery back to starting position. We use a warm up style adopted from NCAA Division 1 Pennsylvania State University’s Tennis Team, which is outcome based but technique orientated, starting with groundstrokes, volleys, alternating both, then both players back, including down the line and cross court quality ball, usually three teams of 15-20 in a row from all courts before we move to next live ball drill.  Usually takes the first 15-20 minutes of practice.</li>
					<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Review objectives for the day, demo of the situation/skill </strong> which we will be focusing on. 5 minutes after the warm up, when all the players are drinking water. Depending on if we are in a preparatory, pre-competitive or competitive phase of our season, practice would be either more general (lots of repetition or volume, footwork, etc.); or if we have some matches and need to get ready, it would be more specific game situations and patterns, like offence-defense (one person attacks the ball), “serve plus one” or “return plus one” (the “plus one” denoting an extra shot is hit in which the objective is to properly set up the point), approach down the line off the high or low ball (to get to the net), etc.  Topics for practice would look like this:</li>

				</ul>
				<div style="margin-left: 3%;">
					<i>
					<p>“Maintaining consistency from the baseline, when receiving wide, close, deep and short balls and 
						footwork necessary to achieving this”</p>
					<p>“Developing a weapon and taking control from the middle of the court, using a forehand”</p>
					<p>“Neutralizing the opponent off their 1st serve and/or attacking their weaker 2nd serve”</p>
					<p>“Approaching and coming to the net in order to take time and space away from opponent”</p>
					<p>“Serve and returns, practicing to hit specific targets with different types of balls (spin, slice, etc.)”</p>
					<p>“Patterns off serve and serve return in order to ensure best position to win the point”</p>
					<p>“Defensive skills when receiving low and/or wide balls which pull you off the court” </p>
					<p>“Doubles strategy, positioning and communication”</p>
					</i>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Stations work.</strong>  This involves basket work with the coach, serve and return practice on one court (targets specific to what is being worked on, like types of serve [eg. win a game just using flat, spin or slice serves]), and finally, a game situation.  Cardio drills with lots of basket fed balls and quicker rotations are used. Emphasis on setting up for the ball through the use of positional bursts, getting behind the ball and maintaining consistent impact height and contact point, and recovering back to the original position after hitting said ball with a recovery burst.  To ensure higher level of demand on players’ footwork, recovery markers are there to give reference as to where players should be recovering to, before performing their split step.  Station work (groups of 4-6 players cycling through each station) includes any mix of:</li>
						<ul>
							<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Hand feeding.</strong> Two players at a time, 3-4 balls being hand fed and players rotate out. Start with closer balls and gradually increase the challenge and court coverage. Rotate columns after each set or half way through basket. Other players are doing the agility ladder, medicine ball, shadow swing.</li>
							<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Basket feeding</strong> from the other side, increase the distance of the feed and add more challenge for players to recognize and track the ball, which is more realistic.</li>
							<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Game situation,</strong> “king of the court”, rally games (3-2-1, 21 points, “la vache”), incorporating the skills and scoring system, as well as rotation, including rotation of players between courts.</li>
							<li style="margin-top: 0.5%;"><strong>Match play.</strong> Singles, doubles or “king of the court”. Coach can circulate and help out players with targeted feedback on tactics, technical and mental aspects.</li>
