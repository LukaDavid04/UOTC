Repository for the University of Ottawa Tennis Club Website, created by Luka David.

The University of Ottawa Tennis Club (UOTC) is the bilingual tennis club of the University of
Ottawa. We are open to all current students of the University of Ottawa. Never picked up a
tennis racket before? Worried you’re not good enough to join? No problem! The UOTC is
composed of three divisions tailored to different players’ tennis levels; Division 1, Division 2,
and Division 3. We hold semester-based tryouts for new students where our dedicated coaching
staff will observe your tennis game and determine which division best suits your level of play.
